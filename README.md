Fork note
---------
This is an experimental fork of precomp, that uses the GrittiBanzli library for
deflate stream recompression.
(https://github.com/google/grittibanzli)


What is Precomp?
----------------
Precomp is a command line precompressor. You can use it to achieve better compression on some file-/streamtypes (works on files and streams that are compressed with zLib or the Deflate compression method, bZip2, GIF, JPG and MP3). Precomp tries to decompress the streams, and if they can be decompressed and "re-"compressed so that they are bit-to-bit-identical with the original stream, the decompressed stream can be used instead of the compressed one.

The result is a .pcf file (PCF = PreCompressedFile) that contains more decompressed data than the original file. Note that this file is larger than the original file, but if you compress it with a compression method stronger than Deflate, the compression is better than before.

Since version 0.4.3, Precomp is available for Linux, too. The Linux and Windows versions are completely compatible, PCF files are exchangeable between Windows and Linux systems.

How can I contribute?
---------------------
* You can have a look at the [Issue list](https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp/issues)
  * If you are looking for easy issues that don't require deeper understanding of the whole project, look for [issues with the `low hanging fruits` tag](https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp/labels/low%20hanging%20fruits)
* You can build the project or download the binaries (see below), run it on your system and report bugs or make enhancement proposals.
